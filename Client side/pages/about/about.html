        In Sydney, you're never far from sand and surf as the harbours, bays,
        and shores are lined with any number of beaches.<br />
        You can go surfing, boating, sailing, snorkeling, diving, or you can
        simply laze away the day under the Sydney sun. <br />
        Of course, you need generally fine days for going to the beach, and
        almost all seasons except winter are fine. <br />
        Among Sydney's better-known seaside sites are Manly Beach and Bondi
        Beach, both quite easy to reach by public transport.

        The big thing in Sydney is, without doubt, the Sydney Opera House. <br />
      It is beautifully located on Sydney Harbour, and is one of Australia's
      World Heritage sites.<br />
      For visitors to Sydney, it is the perfect backdrop for "I was there"
      travel photos.
      <br />You can take your pictures on the approach to the Opera House, on
      its forecourt, <br />
      across the water from West Circular Quay in the vicinity of the Museum of
      Contemporary Art Australia, <br />
      or from Mrs Macquaries Point where you can have both the Opera House and
      Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background.</p

      >Again this is usually part of the "I was there" photographic record and
      for those who do the Bridge Climb a unique "I did that" moment. <br />
      For those who don't climb the bridge, walking or bicycling on the bridge
      across the harbour is certainly possible.<br />
      Sydney Harbour Bridge was 80 years old in 2012, having been officially
      opened in 1932.<br />
      The bridge and Sydney Opera House are Sydney's most iconic features.</p

    >Ah, shopping! <br />
    Depends on what you want to shop for.<br />
    Souvenir items, jewelry, designer clothes, art — you'll find Sydney shops
    with items you may not find anywhere else. <br />
    In the heart of the city, try Queen Victoria Building, Westfield Sydney,
    Strand Arcade, and the boutique shops in this area around Pitt Street
    Mall.
    <br />
    Don't forget The Rocks just northwest of Circular Quay. <br />
    On the way to Bondi Beach, you may wish to do a bit of shopping at
    Westfield Bondi Junction.<br />
    And for bargain items, there are ​markets such as Paddy's in Chinatown.</p >

    >Another tip in Sydney’s cap is the amazing array of food. <br />
    There are incredible fresh food markets selling local produce and freshly
    caught seafood as well as some world-renowned restaurants. <br />
    Some of Sydney’s most celebrated, award winning restaurants include
    Bennelong and Quay.<br />
    For more budget-friendly options check out the Greek food at Apollo,
    Italian at Da Orazio and Bodega for Spanish food.</p
